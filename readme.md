# Advent of Code in Go

> [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

My interpretation of organizing a robust project using go modules

# Requirements

Requires version

# Usage

The project can be run through the command line from either the top level, or from each individual day directory.

From the top level
```bash
go run main.go -year 2015 -day 1 -part 1
```

From the individual directory
```bash
cd 2015/day01

go run main.go -part 1
```
The flags are optional, but default to the first question, 2015 day 1 part 1.
